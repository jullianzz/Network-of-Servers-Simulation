# Network of Servers Simulation w/ Performance Evaluation

A simulator that models the communication between an abstract network of computing resources (i.e. servers, processors, I/O, memory, etc.) for monitoring and performance evaluation purposes. All computing resources are modelled assuming Markovian arrival of requests and Markovian request processing times, which is to assume a Poisson arrival processes and exponentially distributed processing times. Performance metrics like utilization (UTIL), average queue length at the server (QLEN), average response time (TRESP) of each request, and average wait time (TWAIT) of each request are computed using monitor events.
