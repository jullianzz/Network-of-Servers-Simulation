# Network of Queues Simulation and Performance Evaluation

A simulator that models the communication between an abstract network of computing resources (i.e. servers, processors, I/O, memory, etc.). All computing resources are modelled assuming Markovian arrival of requests and Markovian request processing times, which is to assume a Poisson arrival processes and exponentially distributed processing times. 

### Event Modelling Branch (Step 1)
Developed Code to Generate Random Numbers that 
* Implemented the Java function with the following prototype ```double getExp(double lambda)``` in java class file ```Exp.java```. The function accepts one parameter lambda ƛλ𝛌𝜦𝝺𝞴𝞴, which is the rate of arrival of requests. 


### Single Server Queue Branch (Step 2)

### Dual Server Queuing System Branch (Step 3)


### Multiple Server Simulation (Step 4)
